		In 1885 the townspeople of Cannstatt, Germany, were startled to see Paul Daimler, son of Gottlieb Daimler, roll away from No.14 Taubenheimstrasse on a wooden-spoked two-wheeler powered by a fraction of a horsepower four-cycle internal combustion engine. That belt driven motorcycle (actually a four-wheeler as it had two eight-inch diameter outrigger wheels to keep it stable when at a standstill) was the forerunner of all automobiles.

		<p>
		BMW, short for ‘Bayerische Motoren Werke’, which means ‘Bavarian Motor Works’ in English, has come a long way since its inception and has become one of the most popular sports, luxury, and family car manufacturers today. The BMW history started with the efforts of Karl Rapp, who incorporated Rapp Motorenwerke near Oberwiesenfeld.
